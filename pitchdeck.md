### **Education today is broken for billions.**

There is **no global system** that matches people based on the skills they want *and* the skills they can offer.

## 3. Insight

### The world’s biggest educational resource isn’t institutions. It’s **people**.

Everyone knows something worth teaching.
Everyone wants to learn something new.

But there is no infrastructure to enable global, peer-to-peer skill sharing.
